    <p>Established in 2009, this conference aims to provide graduate students with the
      timely opportunity to present their research, exchange ideas, and build their
      collaborative networks within a setting that is supportive yet similar to that of
      a professional conference, such as the Society for Industrial and Applied
      Mathematics (SIAM) and American Mathematical Society (AMS) meetings.
    </p>
    <p>Thematically, the two-day conference centers on recent advances in the theory
      and numerical approximation of partial differential equation (PDE) models in,
      but not limited to, materials science, optics, turbulence, hydrology, biomedical
      flows, and climate systems. Topics include robust and efficient numerical
      simulations, reduced order models, PDE-constrained optimization, uncertainty
      quantification, and data assimilation.
    </p>
    <p>The past graduate student mini-conference were held at Virginia Tech, Clemson
      University, and the University of South Carolina. Auburn University is hosting
      the event in 2022 for the first time.
